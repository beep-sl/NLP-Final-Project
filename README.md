# NLP-Final-Project

## To Run: 

1. Create two Outlook email accounts. Supply one with emails that can be classified by sentiment, such as:

  Body: I love you :)
  
  Body: I hate you :(
  
Create another with emails that can be classified into the following classes (as per the Enron email dataset): 

       'california', 'calendar', 'resumes', 'archives', 'junk file',
       'ces', 'logistics', 'tufco', 'projects', 'online trading',
       'management', 'esvl', 'ooc', 'corporate', 'tw-commercial group',
       'genco-jv_ipo', 'junk', 'deal discrepancies', 'e-mail bin',
       'bill williams iii'
       
2. Download the programs. Supply an email and password to cell 2 of Email_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb. Go ahead and run it.

3. Supply a path to the dataset preprocessed.csv, and an email account to Email_Classification.ipynb. Also run that.

4. Enjoy!
